                Hello, my name is Victoria Orona, and I will graduate from Clovis High School in 2025. I attend Center
                for
                Advanced Research and Technology (CART) to learn several skill sets and explore the different
                possibilities
                when it comes to careers. Currently, I am enrolled in Web Application Development for my first year of
                CART.
                After graduation, I plan on working a part-time job while potentially attending college. Though I donâ€™t
                know
                what career I would want to pursue, I am open to new experiences and always willing to try different
                things.
                I want to be able to have a career that will not only provide for me, but also be enjoyable and
                fulfilling in the
                long-run.
