            Hello, my name is Victoria Orona, and I will graduate from Clovis High School in 2025. I attend Center for
            Advanced Research and Technology (CART) to learn several skill sets and explore the different possibilities
            when it comes to careers. Currently, I am enrolled in Web Application Development for my first year of CART.
            After graduation, I plan on working a part-time job while potentially attending college. Though I donâ€™t know
            what career I would want to pursue, I am open to new experiences and always willing to try different things.
            I want to be able to have a career that will not only provide for me, but also be enjoyable and fulfilling in the
            long-run.
