        <h3>CSS Zen-Garden Project:</h3>
        <p>
            For the CSS Zen-Garden project we used CSS to change the design of the web page. I decided to go for a
            flower theme for my design. I liked the font I chose because it worked well with the theme. This project
            helped with the understanding of CSS selectors and how they work.

        <h3>Jurassic Park Website:</h3>
        <img src="">
        <p>
            For the Jurassic Park website we were required to work in groups and collaborate. My group focused on the
            ticketing aspect of Jurassic Park. We had to figure out the expenses of tickets and transportation, often
            having to communicate with other groups about how to integrate prices for bundles and other products. It
            took us around 4 weeks to complete this project.

        <p>
            The Text Adventure project required us to work in partners to create a story that follows the Heroâ€™s
            Journey. We had to collaborate with our partner and work together with the coding, story elements, as well
            as the different branches and possible outcomes.
