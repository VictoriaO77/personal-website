        <p>
            In English, we were required to write an essay about the book we read, Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton. For
            this essay, I wrote about how understanding chaos theory allows the reader to understand Ian Malcolm, a
            mathematicion.

        <p>
            For the Text Adventure Project, we were required to write a story that follows the 12 steps of the hero's
            journey. Our theme for the story was space, and we wanted it to have a mysterious undertone to it. I did not
            come up with the idea, but I helped write around half of it, including a few of the endings. Writing this
            story has helped me improve on writing skills as well as storytelling skills.
