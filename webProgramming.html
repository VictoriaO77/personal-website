        <h3>Wireframing</h3>
        <p>
            Before we start the coding process, it is important to create a wireframe. A wireframe helps with designing
            and planning out the final layout of the website. First, we start out with a low fidelity wireframe, which
            is mostly focusing on where everthing should go. Then, we start to add text, colors, and pictures, this is
            the high fidelity version of the previous layout. The high fidelity version is the product that we aim to
            duplicate.

        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>
            After completing the high fidelity wireframe, we begin the HTML process. HTML is a coding language that
            focuses on implementing text and images.

        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>
            At this point, the website is not styled at all and there is only text and pictures. This is where CSS is
            implemebted. CSS is a coding language where the developer is able to format and style the website to look
            like the wireframe. This gives the websight the distinct look that you planned it to have.

        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
            The website is almost done, it has text, pictures, and is styled as well. The final component of making the
            website is using JavaScript. JavaScript is a coding language that focuses on the dynamic and interactable
            aspects of making a website. Though proving to be difficult, JavaScript is an essential asset to use when
            creating a website.
